This is generally considered unidiomatic, and you\n should add a `use` statement.\n\n The default maximum segments (2) is pretty strict, you may want to increase this in\n `clippy.toml`.\n\n Note: One exception to this is code from macro expansion - this does not lint such cases, as\n using absolute paths is the proper way of referencing items in one.\n\n ### Known issues\n\n There are currently a few cases which are not caught by this lint:\n * Macro calls. e.g. `path::to::macro!()`\n * Derive macros. e.g. `#[derive(path::to::macro)]`\n * Attribute macros. e.g. `#[path::to::macro]`\n\n ### Example\n ```no_run\n let x = std::f64::consts::PI;\n ```\n Use any of the below instead, or anything else:\n ```no_run\n use std::f64;\n use std::f64::consts;\n use std::f64::consts::PI;\n let x = f64::consts::PI;\n let x = consts::PI;\n let x = PI;\n use std::f64::consts as f64_consts;\n let x = f64_consts::PI;\n ```\n\n### Configuration\n\n- `absolute-paths-allowed-crates`:  Which crates to allow absolute paths from\n\n\n   (default: `[]`)\n- `absolute-paths-max-segments`:  The maximum number of segments a path can have before being linted, anything above this will\n be linted.\n\n\n   (default: `2`)\n",

In this case the use of `const` is legit,\n and this lint should be suppressed.\n\n Even though the lint avoids triggering on a constant whose type has enums that have variants\n with interior mutability, and its value uses non interior mutable variants (see\n [#3962](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/3962) and\n [#3825](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/3825) for examples);\n it complains about associated constants without default values only based on its types;\n which might not be preferable.\n There're other enums plus associated constants cases that the lint cannot handle.\n\n Types that have underlying or potential interior mutability trigger the lint whether\n the interior mutable field is used or not.

    "docs": " ### What it does\n Checks for integer validity checks, followed by a transmute that is (incorrectly) evaluated\n eagerly (e.g. using `bool::then_some`).\n\n ### Why is this bad?\n Eager evaluation means that the `transmute` call is executed regardless of whether the condition is true or false.\n This can introduce unsoundness and other subtle bugs.\n\n ### Example\n Consider the following function which is meant to convert an unsigned integer to its enum equivalent via transmute.\n\n ```no_run\n #[repr(u8)]\n enum Opcode {\n     Add = 0,\n     Sub = 1,\n     Mul = 2,\n     Div = 3\n }\n\n fn int_to_opcode(op: u8) -> Option<Opcode> {\n     (op < 4).then_some(unsafe { std::mem::transmute(op) })\n }\n ```\n This may appear fine at first given that it checks that the `u8` is within the validity range of the enum,\n *however* the transmute is evaluated eagerly, meaning that it executes even if `op >= 4`!\n\n This makes the function unsound, because it is possible for the caller to cause undefined behavior\n (creating an enum with an invalid bitpattern) entirely in safe code only by passing an incorrect value,\n which is normally only a bug that is possible in unsafe code.\n\n One possible way in which this can go wrong practically is that the compiler sees it as:\n ```rust,ignore (illustrative)\n let temp: Foo = unsafe { std::mem::transmute(op) };\n (0 < 4).then_some(temp)\n ```\n and optimizes away the `(0 < 4)` check based on the assumption that since a `Foo` was created from `op` with the validity range `0..3`,\n it is **impossible** for this condition to be false.\n\n In short, it is possible for this function to be optimized in a way that makes it [never return `None`](https://godbolt.org/z/ocrcenevq),\n even if passed the value `4`.\n\n This can be avoided by instead using lazy evaluation. For the example above, this should be written:\n ```rust,ignore (illustrative)\n fn int_to_opcode(op: u8) -> Option<Opcode> {\n     (op < 4).then(|| unsafe { std::mem::transmute(op) })\n              ^^^^ ^^ `bool::then` only executes the closure if the condition is true!\n }\n ```\n",

If the field is not visible, then the struct\n   acts like any other struct with private fields.\n\n * If the enum has no variants only because all variants happen to be\n   [disabled by conditional compilation][cfg], then it would be appropriate\n   to allow the lint, with `#[allow(empty_enum)]`.\n\n For further information, visit\n [the never type’s documentation][`!`].\n\n ### Example\n ```no_run\n enum CannotExist {}\n ```\n\n Use instead:\n ```no_run\n #![feature(never_type)]\n\n /// Use the `!` type directly...\n type CannotExist = !;\n\n /// ...or define a newtype which is distinct.\n struct CannotExist2(pub !);\n ```\n\n [`!`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.never.html\n [cfg]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/conditional-compilation.html\n [newtype]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-04-advanced-types.html#using-the-newtype-pattern-for-type-safety-and-abstraction\n [visibility]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/visibility-and-privacy.html\n",

Generic code\n typically uses `Borrow<T>` when it relies on the identical behavior of these additional trait\n implementations. These traits will likely appear as additional trait bounds.\n\n In particular `Eq`, `Ord` and `Hash` must be equivalent for borrowed and owned values:\n `x.borrow() == y.borrow()` should give the same result as `x == y`.\n It follows then that the following equivalence must hold:\n `hash(x) == hash((x as Borrow<[u8]>).borrow()) == hash((x as Borrow<str>).borrow())`\n\n Unfortunately it doesn't hold as `hash(\"abc\") != hash(\"abc\".as_bytes())`.\n This happens because the `Hash` impl for str passes an additional `0xFF` byte to\n the hasher to avoid collisions. For example, given the tuples `(\"a\", \"bc\")`, and `(\"ab\", \"c\")`,\n the two tuples would have the same hash value if the `0xFF` byte was not added.\n\n ### Example\n\n ```\n use std::borrow::Borrow;\n use std::hash::{Hash, Hasher};\n\n struct ExampleType {\n     data: String\n }\n\n impl Hash for ExampleType {\n     fn hash<H: Hasher>(&self, state: &mut H) {\n         self.data.hash(state);\n     }\n }\n\n impl Borrow<str> for ExampleType {\n     fn borrow(&self) -> &str {\n         &self.data\n     }\n }\n\n impl Borrow<[u8]> for ExampleType {\n     fn borrow(&self) -> &[u8] {\n         self.data.as_bytes()\n     }\n }\n ```\n As a consequence, hashing a `&ExampleType` and hashing the result of the two\n borrows will result in different values.\n\n",

    "docs": " ### What it does\n Checks for usage of indexing or slicing. Arrays are special cases, this lint\n does report on arrays if we can tell that slicing operations are in bounds and does not\n lint on constant `usize` indexing on arrays because that is handled by rustc's `const_err` lint.\n\n ### Why restrict this?\n To avoid implicit panics from indexing and slicing.\n There are “checked” alternatives which do not panic, and can be used with `unwrap()` to make\n an explicit panic when it is desired.\n\n ### Example\n ```rust,no_run\n // Vector\n let x = vec![0; 5];\n\n x[2];\n &x[2..100];\n\n // Array\n let y = [0, 1, 2, 3];\n\n &y[10..100];\n &y[10..];\n ```\n\n Use instead:\n ```no_run\n # let x = vec![0; 5];\n # let y = [0, 1, 2, 3];\n x.get(2);\n x.get(2..100);\n\n y.get(10);\n y.get(10..100);\n ```\n\n### Configuration\n\n- `suppress-restriction-lint-in-const`:  Whether to suppress a restriction lint in constant code. In same\n cases the restructured operation might not be unavoidable, as the\n suggested counterparts are unavailable in constant code. This\n configuration will cause restriction lints to trigger even\n if no suggestion can be made.\n\n\n   (default: `false`)\n",

    "docs": " ### What it does\n Checks for functions that use a lot of stack space.\n\n This often happens when constructing a large type, such as an array with a lot of elements,\n or constructing *many* smaller-but-still-large structs, or copying around a lot of large types.\n\n This lint is a more general version of [`large_stack_arrays`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/#large_stack_arrays)\n that is intended to look at functions as a whole instead of only individual array expressions inside of a function.\n\n ### Why is this bad?\n The stack region of memory is very limited in size (usually *much* smaller than the heap) and attempting to\n use too much will result in a stack overflow and crash the program.\n To avoid this, you should consider allocating large types on the heap instead (e.g. by boxing them).\n\n Keep in mind that the code path to construction of large types does not even need to be reachable;\n it purely needs to *exist* inside of the function to contribute to the stack size.\n For example, this causes a stack overflow even though the branch is unreachable:\n ```rust,ignore\n fn main() {\n     if false {\n         let x = [0u8; 10000000]; // 10 MB stack array\n         black_box(&x);\n     }\n }\n ```\n\n ### Known issues\n False positives. The stack size that clippy sees is an estimated value and can be vastly different\n from the actual stack usage after optimizations passes have run (especially true in release mode).\n Modern compilers are very smart and are able to optimize away a lot of unnecessary stack allocations.\n In debug mode however, it is usually more accurate.\n\n This lint works by summing up the size of all variables that the user typed, variables that were\n implicitly introduced by the compiler for temporaries, function arguments and the return value,\n and comparing them against a (configurable, but high-by-default).\n\n ### Example\n This function creates four 500 KB arrays on the stack. Quite big but just small enough to not trigger `large_stack_arrays`.\n However, looking at the function as a whole, it's clear that this uses a lot of stack space.\n ```no_run\n struct QuiteLargeType([u8; 500_000]);\n fn foo() {\n     // ... some function that uses a lot of stack space ...\n     let _x1 = QuiteLargeType([0; 500_000]);\n     let _x2 = QuiteLargeType([0; 500_000]);\n     let _x3 = QuiteLargeType([0; 500_000]);\n     let _x4 = QuiteLargeType([0; 500_000]);\n }\n ```\n\n Instead of doing this, allocate the arrays on the heap.\n This currently requires going through a `Vec` first and then converting it to a `Box`:\n ```no_run\n struct NotSoLargeType(Box<[u8]>);\n\n fn foo() {\n     let _x1 = NotSoLargeType(vec![0; 500_000].into_boxed_slice());\n //                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Now heap allocated.\n //                                                                The size of `NotSoLargeType` is 16 bytes.\n //  ...\n }\n ```\n\n### Configuration\n\n- `stack-size-threshold`:  The maximum allowed stack size for functions in bytes\n\n\n   (default: `512000`)\n",

    "docs": " ### What it does\n Checks for repeated slice indexing without asserting beforehand that the length\n is greater than the largest index used to index into the slice.\n\n ### Why restrict this?\n In the general case where the compiler does not have a lot of information\n about the length of a slice, indexing it repeatedly will generate a bounds check\n for every single index.\n\n Asserting that the length of the slice is at least as large as the largest value\n to index beforehand gives the compiler enough information to elide the bounds checks,\n effectively reducing the number of bounds checks from however many times\n the slice was indexed to just one (the assert).\n\n ### Drawbacks\n False positives. It is, in general, very difficult to predict how well\n the optimizer will be able to elide bounds checks and it very much depends on\n the surrounding code. For example, indexing into the slice yielded by the\n [`slice::chunks_exact`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.slice.html#method.chunks_exact)\n iterator will likely have all of the bounds checks elided even without an assert\n if the `chunk_size` is a constant.\n\n Asserts are not tracked across function calls. Asserting the length of a slice\n in a different function likely gives the optimizer enough information\n about the length of a slice, but this lint will not detect that.\n\n ### Example\n ```no_run\n fn sum(v: &[u8]) -> u8 {\n     // 4 bounds checks\n     v[0] + v[1] + v[2] + v[3]\n }\n ```\n Use instead:\n ```no_run\n fn sum(v: &[u8]) -> u8 {\n     assert!(v.len() > 3);\n     // no bounds checks\n     v[0] + v[1] + v[2] + v[3]\n }\n ```\n",

For example, if `transmute()` is the tail\n expression of an `if`-branch, and the `else`-branch type changes, the compiler may silently\n infer a different type to be returned by `transmute()`. That is because the compiler is\n free to change the inference of a type as long as that inference is technically correct,\n regardless of the programmer's unknown expectation.\n\n Both type-parameters, the input- and the output-type, to any `transmute()` should\n be given explicitly: Setting the input-type explicitly avoids confusion about what the\n argument's type actually is. Setting the output-type explicitly avoids type-inference\n to infer a technically correct yet unexpected type.\n\n ### Example\n ```no_run\n # unsafe {\n // Avoid \"naked\" calls to `transmute()`!\n let x: i32 = std::mem::transmute([1u16, 2u16]);\n\n // `first_answers` is intended to transmute a slice of bool to a slice of u8.\n // But the programmer forgot to index the first element of the outer slice,\n // so we are actually transmuting from \"pointers to slices\" instead of\n // transmuting from \"a slice of bool\", causing a nonsensical result.\n let the_answers: &[&[bool]] = &[&[true, false, true]];\n let first_answers: &[u8] = std::mem::transmute(the_answers);\n # }\n ```\n Use instead:\n ```no_run\n # unsafe {\n let x = std::mem::transmute::<[u16; 2], i32>([1u16, 2u16]);\n\n // The explicit type parameters on `transmute()` makes the intention clear,\n // and cause a type-error if the actual types don't match our expectation.\n let the_answers: &[&[bool]] = &[&[true, false, true]];\n let first_answers: &[u8] = std::mem::transmute::<&[bool], &[u8]>(the_answers[0]);\n # }\n ```\n",

Its rule can filter out basic cases such as\n `Vec<*const T>`, but it's not perfect. Feel free to create an issue if\n you have a suggestion on how this heuristic can be improved.\n\n ### Example\n ```rust,ignore\n struct ExampleStruct<T> {\n     rc_is_not_send: Rc<String>,\n     unbounded_generic_field: T,\n }\n\n // This impl is unsound because it allows sending `!Send` types through `ExampleStruct`\n unsafe impl<T> Send for ExampleStruct<T> {}\n ```\n Use thread-safe types like [`std::sync::Arc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html)\n or specify correct bounds on generic type parameters (`T: Send`).\n\n### Configuration\n\n- `enable-raw-pointer-heuristic-for-send`:  Whether to apply the raw pointer heuristic to determine if a type is `Send`.\n\n\n   (default: `true`)\n",

This is also true for internal APIs, as it is easy to leak\n unsoundness.\n\n ### Context\n In Rust, an `unsafe {...}` block is used to indicate that the code in that\n section has been verified in some way that the compiler can not. For a\n function that accepts a raw pointer then accesses the pointer's data, this is\n generally impossible as the incoming pointer could point anywhere, valid or\n not. So, the signature should be marked `unsafe fn`: this indicates that the\n function's caller must provide some verification that the arguments it sends\n are valid (and then call the function within an `unsafe` block).\n\n ### Known problems\n * It does not check functions recursively so if the pointer is passed to a\n private non-`unsafe` function which does the dereferencing, the lint won't\n trigger (false negative).\n * It only checks for arguments whose type are raw pointers, not raw pointers\n got from an argument in some other way (`fn foo(bar: &[*const u8])` or\n `some_argument.get_raw_ptr()`) (false negative).\n\n ### Example\n ```rust,ignore\n pub fn foo(x: *const u8) {\n     println!(\"{}\", unsafe { *x });\n }\n\n // this call \"looks\" safe but will segfault or worse!\n // foo(invalid_ptr);\n ```\n\n Use instead:\n ```rust,ignore\n pub unsafe fn foo(x: *const u8) {\n     println!(\"{}\", unsafe { *x });\n }\n\n // this would cause a compiler error for calling without `unsafe`\n // foo(invalid_ptr);\n\n // sound call if the caller knows the pointer is valid\n unsafe { foo(valid_ptr); }\n ```\n",

For example, `\\033`\n stands for the ASCII character 27 (ESC).

    "docs": " ### What it does\n Checks for patterns that aren't exact representations of the types\n they are applied to.\n\n To satisfy this lint, you will have to adjust either the expression that is matched\n against or the pattern itself, as well as the bindings that are introduced by the\n adjusted patterns. For matching you will have to either dereference the expression\n with the `*` operator, or amend the patterns to explicitly match against `&<pattern>`\n or `&mut <pattern>` depending on the reference mutability. For the bindings you need\n to use the inverse. You can leave them as plain bindings if you wish for the value\n to be copied, but you must use `ref mut <variable>` or `ref <variable>` to construct\n a reference into the matched structure.\n\n If you are looking for a way to learn about ownership semantics in more detail, it\n is recommended to look at IDE options available to you to highlight types, lifetimes\n and reference semantics in your code. The available tooling would expose these things\n in a general way even outside of the various pattern matching mechanics. Of course\n this lint can still be used to highlight areas of interest and ensure a good understanding\n of ownership semantics.\n\n ### Why restrict this?\n It increases ownership hints in the code, and will guard against some changes\n in ownership.\n\n ### Example\n This example shows the basic adjustments necessary to satisfy the lint. Note how\n the matched expression is explicitly dereferenced with `*` and the `inner` variable\n is bound to a shared borrow via `ref inner`.\n\n ```rust,ignore\n // Bad\n let value = &Some(Box::new(23));\n match value {\n     Some(inner) => println!(\"{}\", inner),\n     None => println!(\"none\"),\n }\n\n // Good\n let value = &Some(Box::new(23));\n match *value {\n     Some(ref inner) => println!(\"{}\", inner),\n     None => println!(\"none\"),\n }\n ```\n\n The following example demonstrates one of the advantages of the more verbose style.\n Note how the second version uses `ref mut a` to explicitly declare `a` a shared mutable\n borrow, while `b` is simply taken by value. This ensures that the loop body cannot\n accidentally modify the wrong part of the structure.\n\n ```rust,ignore\n // Bad\n let mut values = vec![(2, 3), (3, 4)];\n for (a, b) in &mut values {\n     *a += *b;\n }\n\n // Good\n let mut values = vec![(2, 3), (3, 4)];\n for &mut (ref mut a, b) in &mut values {\n     *a += b;\n }\n ```\n",

When returned, the owner must internally store\n it as `Option<T>` in order to return it.\n At a lower level, `&Option<T>` points to memory with the `presence` bit flag plus the `T` value,\n whereas `Option<&T>` is usually [optimized](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.81.0/std/option/index.html#representation)\n to a single pointer, so it may be more optimal.\n\n See this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c7pZYP_iIE) by\n Logan Smith for an in-depth explanation of why this is important.\n\n ### Known problems\n This lint recommends changing the function signatures, but it cannot\n automatically change the function calls or the function implementations.\n\n ### Example\n ```no_run\n // caller uses  foo(&opt)\n fn foo(a: &Option<String>) {}\n # struct Unit {}\n # impl Unit {\n fn bar(&self) -> &Option<String> { &None }\n # }\n ```\n Use instead:\n ```no_run\n // caller should use  `foo1(opt.as_ref())`\n fn foo1(a: Option<&String>) {}\n // better yet, use string slice  `foo2(opt.as_deref())`\n fn foo2(a: Option<&str>) {}\n # struct Unit {}\n # impl Unit {\n fn bar(&self) -> Option<&String> { None }\n # }\n ```\n\n### Configuration\n\n- `avoid-breaking-exported-api`:  Suppress lints whenever the suggested change would cause breakage for other crates.\n\n\n   (default: `true`)\n",

If you follow the\n conventions, your users won't be surprised that they, e.g., need to supply a\n mutable reference to a `as_..` function.\n\n ### Example\n ```no_run\n # struct X;\n impl X {\n     fn as_str(self) -> &'static str {\n         // ..\n # \"\"\n     }\n }\n ```\n\n Use instead:\n ```no_run\n # struct X;\n impl X {\n     fn as_str(&self) -> &'static str {\n         // ..\n # \"\"\n     }\n }\n ```\n\n### Configuration\n\n- `avoid-breaking-exported-api`:  Suppress lints whenever the suggested change would cause breakage for other crates.\n\n\n   (default: `true`)\n",
